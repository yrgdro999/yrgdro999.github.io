        <li>Common Anti Ukraine/NATO Talking Points involve:
            <ul>
                <li>Ukraine is corrupt; Hunder Biden, Viktor Shokin, US-led coup.</li>
                <li>Ukraine is full of Nazi nationalists.</li>

    <li>Israel/Palestine</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem without any Palestinian leader at the table, with Abbas, who, 
            granted cannot always be trusted, has vocally supported a two-state solution and holds an incredibly low approval ratings in the West Bank, is questionable.</li>
        <li> Remember, the West Bank is more sympathetic to Hamas, the governing body of the Gaza Strip, 
            with polls showing way higher approval of Hamas with civilians of the West Bank compared to the civilians of the Gaza Strip.</li>

<h3>Public Transit</h3>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<h3>First Amendment</h3>
<h3>Second Amendment</h3>
<h3>Reasons Why Donald Trump is a Fascist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Advocated for revoking citizenship for individuals who burn the American flag.</li>
      <li>Using <em>legal</em> means to overturn the election results by investigating voter fraud, even though multiple battleground state Biden Won, with Republican officials, said to him that they investigated it and Biden was the legitimate winner of the state. This seems parallel to how Hitler came into power with the Enabling Act.
        <ul>
          <li>GA Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger</li>
          <li>Maricopa County, AZ, Board of Supervisors (4 out of 5 Republican), Arizona State Legislature (31 to 29 Republican), and the Governor (Republican).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Trump pressuring Pence to overturn the election, and accepting the fake slate of electors.
        <ul>
          <li>Trump said to Pence, "You're too honest", on January 6th, 2021.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Says he wants to "suspend the constitution"</li>
      <li>Wanting to expand libel laws for media corporations who criticized him.</li>
      <li>Now has absolute or presumptive criminal immunity from all actions, as long as its an official act, or deemed a core duty of the president. The President can theoretically order the Attorney General to assassinate a political opponent due to 'national security' reasons, but in reality without any specific reason, and that would not be able to be investigated for criminal activity. Subsequently, the classified documents case was dismissed.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Election Integrity - January 6th</h2>
      <li>2016 Election</li>
      <li>2020 Election</li>
        

    <ul>
      <li>The claim that assets in Russia <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/fieldable-panel-panes/basic-panes/attachments/2018/02/16/internet_research_agency_indictment.pdf" target="_blank">interfered</a> with the 2016 presidential election.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Then-President Donald Trump arguably engaged in a clear attempted coup d'รฉtat leading up to January 6th, 2021.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Demanding Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election results as the 1st session of the United States 117th Congress was in the process of certifying the electors from each state, and certifying Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the next President of the U.S. Trump would allow Pence to throw the Electoral College to the House of Representatives, and since Republicans edged the House Delegates 26 to 24, it was safe to assume Trump would have stayed in power.
            <ul>
              <li>Pence did not have the authority to do this, however this still by definition is an <em>attempted</em> coup d'รฉtat.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Trump was angry he lost critical battleground states like Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Nevada.</li>
          <li>Using a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-fake-electors-wisconsin-fff7cd21e3083f300874eccd69141f8d" target="_blank">legal theory</a> provided by John Eastman to send fake electors from Wisconsin.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How The Wisconsin Fake Elector Scheme Worked (and admitted plan; all factual information or in the words of Trump & his team)</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>WI had 10 electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election. (8 HR, 2 S)</li>
          <li>The electors for WI are, 8, one for each congressional district, and 2 more to represent the state at-large. So 10 total electors.</li>
          <li>After the election winner in the state is determined,</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Court Cases regarding the Trump-appointed plaintiffs</li>
      <li>2020 Presidential Election was incredibly secure, with no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Again, even citing <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf" target="_blank">first-hand statements</a> (starting on page 22, with FULL quotes cited) made by notable people from TRUMP'S own cabinet and republicans, said as much.
